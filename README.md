- 👋 Hi, I’m @szuiker
- 👀 I’m interested in platform technologies that support ecosystem integration in the education sector.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about web3 innovations like "distributed autonomous systems", specifically as they relate to platform-ecosystem integration.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovations that inspire and enable value creation among youth and the educators who accompany them through schooling
